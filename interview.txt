Q: How did you become interested in communication design?
A: Design has always been part of my life, but comm design combines my love of art and a collaborative people focused process that I really am thriving in.

Q: What are some of the forces that animate your work?
A: I use my art as a visual form of communication! I struggled with traditional education and book learning so I used art to bridge the gap and it became a very personal and vital part of my experience.

Q: What themes, motifs, or symbols connect your body of work? 
A: Folkart, identity, nature, and expression. I love to make art about what I am experiencing and who I am. It is a way for me to digest and understand myself. Folkart and nature are visual cues that I seek out in the art that I consume, and identity is so tied to everything I make and hope to make.

Q: Describe the process of creating your "Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy" poster.
A: My cowboy poster is a project I made for a Data Visualization course last year. It explores my relationship to queerness and western cowboy culture. I am a queer person and I listen to lots of sad gay cowboy music. I challenged myself to make a more technical design while still pushing the visual systems in a limited color scheme. I love this one.
